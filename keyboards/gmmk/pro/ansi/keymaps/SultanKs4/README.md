# SultanKs4's GMMK Pro layout

This is pretty much the stock layout with a few things moved around.

The differences are as follows:

- Short DEBOUNCE time (5 ms)
- Per-key debounce algorithm (sym_defer_pk)
- RGB turns off after 10 minutes of inactivity
- RGB turns off when USB is suspended
- Layer 1 (accessed by pressing Fn):
  - Fn + . -> Next
  - Fn + , -> Previous
  - Fn + P -> Play
  - Fn + Delete -> Insert
  - Fn + End -> Home
  - Fn + E -> RGB Saturation +
  - Fn + D -> RGB Saturation -
  - Fn + R -> RGB Hue +
  - Fn + F -> RGB Hue -

This keymap also includes CAPS LOCK ON indicator.\
All left and right side LEDs, and the Caps key LED will turn dark blue (#001239) while CAPS LOCK is ON.
